# Advent Notes

## Day 01
This was fun. I first visualized the walking and was nearly 
able too visually identify the solutions of the base excercise AND the additional second start excercise. In the end I over engeneered it and calculated the intersection with more math than necessary in this grid based world.

## Day 02
Easier than Day 01. Beginning with rows & columns and a simple move check
was just the right decision for the second star variant.
